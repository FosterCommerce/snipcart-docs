# Overview

If you're comfortable working with PHP, there's a lot more you can do with this plugin. It utilizes a complete set of Craft-friendly data models, exposes just about all functionality in its services, and should make interacting with Snipcart a breeze.

::: tip
If you're not already using [PhpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/), it will make working with this plugin (and Craft and all other plugins!) much faster. Any service and bit of Snipcart data you work with will have its methods and properties listed in an autocomplete dropdown, among other things.
